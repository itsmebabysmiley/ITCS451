# Assignment2

### *In this assignment, you can work in a group of up to 4 members. You can also work across sections. Please only make one submission.*

*Please keep in mind that a bigger group is meant to help me grade more efficiently. It is bad for you if you do not participate in group work. I recommend that you first work alone, then check your work with your team members. Finally, make one submission. Your future self will thank you.*

### 

### Background

We are going to create a tic-tac-toe agent -- an agent that will never lose the game of tic-tac-toe. Our agent can be either an X player or an O player, and the X player always starts first.

### Choices

1. Answer Question 1 and Question 2
2. Implement Tic-tac-toe formulation + Minimax Search
3. Implement Tic-tac-toe formulation + Alpha-beta Search

The total score in this assignment is 10 and it worths 5% of the class.

### Question 1

Please formulate this problem into an adversarial search problem.

Criteria (3 points):

1. 0.5pt: You correctly identify information to maintain in the state.
2. 0.5pt: You correctly identify a list of all possible actions
3. 1.0pt: You correctly describe the transition function and you show examples of how the transition function works for all actions. (show player, input state, action, and the output state).
4. 0.5pt: You correctly describe the terminal test function and show some examples.
5. 0.5pt: You correctly describe a utility function and show at least 3 examples (player, state, and its utility value).

### Question 2

Please perform the alpha-beta search to find an optimal move. You can start the search when there are only 3-4 positions left on the board (depending on whether our agent is X or O). Please make sure that your starting state is a non-terminal state.

Criteria (4 points):

1. 1pt: You keep track of alpha and beta values correctly.
2. 1pt: You correctly prune the nodes according to the alpha-beta rule. If your search does not have any pruning, you will not get this point.
3. 1pt: You compute the minimax values of most of the nodes correctly.
4. 1pt: You correctly identify the best move.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Formulation

Criteria (4 points)

1. 1pt: Your code run (play_with_bot.py) without any error.
2. 0.5pt: For each correct item of the formulation.

### Minimax Search

Criteria (4 points)

1. 1pt: Your code run (play_with_bot.py using Minimax) without any error.
2. 1pt: Your agent takes an optimal move.
3. 1pt: You implement "Min" correctly
4. 1pt: You implement "Max" correctly

### 

### Alpha-Beta Search

Criteria (6 points)

1. 1pt: Your code run (play_with_bot.py using Alpha-beta) without any error.
2. 1pt: Your agent takes an optimal move.
3. 1pt: You implement "Min" correctly
4. 1pt: You implement "Max" correctly
5. 2pt: Your implement alpha-beta pruning correctly
